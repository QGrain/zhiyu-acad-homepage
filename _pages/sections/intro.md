I am a Phd student at Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences starting in September 2021, supervised by [Kai Chen](https://kaichen.org/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree with honors from School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2021. During that time, I was also an member (Official ID: 637) of [Dian Group](https://dian.org.cn/) in HUST.

My research interests include software and system security, especially fuzzing and program analysis. I am passionate about finding vulnerabities in software systems (e.g., Open Source Software, Android Applications, and OS Kernels) and leveraging AI (e.g., LLMs) to make the entire process more intelligent and efficient. In my spare time, I enjoy playing some CTF competitions (as a member of NeSE-B), basketball, and singing.
